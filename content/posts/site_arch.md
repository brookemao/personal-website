### Frontend

I use Hugo and the Papermod theme to generate a static site. There's some custom CSS and layouts for the links and the Friendnet page, but otherwise nothing else is changed from the theme.

### Backend

The site itself is hosted on Cloudflare Pages; it is automatically built and deployed by Cloudflare's Github integration whenever commits are pushed to https://github.com/brookemao/personal-website. Terraform is used to build the hosting infrastructure, the code is located at https://github.com/brookemao/website-tf. The TF state is stored both locally and remotely in a GCP Cloud Storage bucket.
